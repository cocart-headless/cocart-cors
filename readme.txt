= Recommended Requirements =

* WordPress v6.0 or higher.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don‚Äôt need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart CORS Support, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CoCart CORS" and click Search Plugins. Once you‚Äôve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
